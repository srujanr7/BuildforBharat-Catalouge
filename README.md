#Conversational Interface for Online Shopping: 

Problem Statement:

In the world of online shopping, bridging the gap between the convenience of digital transactions and the tactile experience of physical stores remains a significant challenge. This challenge is particularly pronounced in markets like India, where the reliance on physical shopping experiences, guided by assistants, is deeply ingrained in consumer behavior. Moreover, non-tech savvy users often find themselves struggling with the complexities of navigating through online interfaces, exacerbating the trust deficit in online purchases.

To address these issues, there's a need for innovative solutions that provide a more immersive and intuitive online shopping experience. One such solution involves the development of a conversational interface that not only guides users through the online shopping journey but also replicates the "look and feel" aspect of physical shopping. By leveraging natural language interactions and immersive features like virtual try-ons for fashion items, this conversational interface aims to build trust and enhance the online shopping experience, particularly for non-tech savvy users.

Code Description:

The provided code showcases a rudimentary implementation of a conversational interface for online shopping using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Data Loading and Global Variables: The code initializes a global variable to store the loaded data from a CSV file containing order information.

Data Retrieval Functions: Two functions are defined to retrieve orders based on either customer ID or order ID from the loaded data. These functions ensure that the data is loaded before querying.

Streamlit UI Components: The code sets up the user interface using Streamlit components. It allows users to select the input type (customer ID or order ID) via radio buttons and input the corresponding ID via text input boxes.

Data Loading and Input Handling: The code attempts to load the CSV data into a DataFrame upon running the app. Users can then input either a customer ID or an order ID.

Data Retrieval and Display: Upon clicking the retrieval button, the app calls the appropriate function to retrieve orders or dates based on the input value. The retrieved information is displayed in the app interface, along with appropriate warning messages if no matching records are found.

Overall, while the provided code offers a basic framework for a conversational interface, further development and integration with more advanced natural language processing and immersive technologies would be necessary to create a robust solution that truly enhances the online shopping experience.
